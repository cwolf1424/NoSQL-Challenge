# NoSQL-challenge
Challenge assignment for Mongo

Data for this project was from the provided project files.

Layout for assignment came from starter file.

Specific sections using sources listed below:

--------------------------------------------------
Setup (Part 1)
--------------------------------------------------

Some dependency imports provided in starter file.

The following sections were also provided:

    # Create an instance of MongoClient
    mongo = MongoClient(port=27017)

    # assign the uk_food database to a variable name
    db = mongo['uk_food']

    # assign the collection to a variable
    establishments = db['establishments']

Bigyan from AskBCS helped with the importing of the database via the command line as my mongoimport was not set up properly:

    mongoimport --type json -d uk_food -c establishments --drop --jsonArray establishmens.json
